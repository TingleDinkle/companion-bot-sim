# Companion Bot Simulation

This Unity project creates a digital robot companion with the following implemented functions: autonomous navigation and pathfinding, mood changes (idle, curious, excited, sleepy, playful), adaptive behavior learning, mini-games (cube stacking and pattern puzzles), user interaction responses, animations and sound effects, desktop overlay mode, and save/load functionality.

Advanced Feature: Optional real desktop interactions (WARNING: Can manipulate actual Windows apps/windows - use at own risk! Allow in configuration settings).

Setup: Open SampleScene in Unity → Drag Cozmo.fbx model into scene → attach MasterCoordinator script (auto-sets up everything!) → bake NavMesh → build for desktop. For automatic setup: Editor menu > Robot Companion > Complete Setup (requires editor script).

^ this is reminder for myself. HEAVY WIP NOT DONE.


# UPDATE
Sorry to dissapoint, I have a new idea for this, refactoring everything and outlining the concepts first before I do, this repo will be kept as a first draft of my next big project after Sanity Orb, stay tuned :)
