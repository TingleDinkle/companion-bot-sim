# Companion Bot Simulation

This Unity project creates a digital robot companion with the following implemented functions: autonomous navigation and pathfinding, mood changes (idle, curious, excited, sleepy, playful), adaptive behavior learning, mini-games (cube stacking and pattern puzzles), user interaction responses, animations and sound effects, desktop overlay mode, and save/load functionality.

Advanced Feature: Optional real desktop interactions (WARNING: Can manipulate actual Windows apps/windows - use at own risk! Allow in configuration settings).

NOT FINISHED, HEAVY WIP.
